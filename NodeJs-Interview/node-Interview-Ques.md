Sure! Aapke instructions follow karte hue, main har concept ko answer karunga, phir ek example ke sath code aur expected output bhi provide karunga.

---

### 1. **What is Node.js?**

#### Answer:
Node.js ek open-source, cross-platform runtime environment hai jo JavaScript ko server-side pe execute karne ke liye use hota hai. Yeh event-driven, non-blocking I/O model pe kaam karta hai, jisse performance aur scalability better hoti hai, especially for real-time applications like chat, APIs, etc.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example of a basic HTTP server in Node.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Server running at http://localhost:3000/
(Opening http://localhost:3000/ will show "Hello, World!")
```

---

### 2. **Why is Node.js single-threaded?**

#### Answer:
Node.js single-threaded hai because it follows an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Single-threaded architecture ka benefit ye hai ki it efficiently handles a large number of concurrent requests without creating new threads for each request. Instead, the event loop takes care of task execution asynchronously.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example of non-blocking I/O
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File data:', data);
});

console.log('This will run first, even if file reading is not done.');
```

#### Output:
```
This will run first, even if file reading is not done.
File data: <Contents of file.txt>
```

---

### 3. **Explain the event-driven architecture in Node.js.**

#### Answer:
Node.js mein event-driven architecture ka matlab hai ki system asynchronous events pe react karta hai. Jab koi event (like HTTP request) trigger hota hai, toh Node.js us event ko handle karta hai without blocking the main execution thread. Each I/O operation generates an event, and when the event completes, the callback function is executed.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example of event-driven code with an HTTP request
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    res.end('<h1>Welcome to Node.js Event-Driven Server!</h1>');
  }
});

server.on('request', (req) => {
  console.log('A new request was made at:', req.url);
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
A new request was made at: /
```

---

### 4. **What is the event loop in Node.js, and how does it work?**

#### Answer:
Event loop Node.js ka core hai jo asynchronous tasks ko manage karta hai. Event loop ensures ki JavaScript synchronous code ke baad asynchronous tasks (like file I/O or API calls) ko handle kar sake. Event loop continuously tasks ki queue ko check karta hai aur jo task ready hota hai, usko handle karta hai.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example to demonstrate event loop
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

#### Output:
```
Start
End
Timeout callback
```

---

### 5. **How does Node.js handle asynchronous code?**

#### Answer:
Node.js asynchronous code ko event loop ke through handle karta hai, jisme callbacks, promises, aur async/await patterns ka use hota hai. Jab koi asynchronous function execute hota hai (like HTTP request), Node.js us function ko event loop ke sath manage karta hai, aur jab response ready hota hai, callback function ko execute karta hai.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example using async/await for asynchronous code
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log('File data:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
  }
}

readFile();

console.log('This runs before the file is read.');
```

#### Output:
```
This runs before the file is read.
File data: <Contents of file.txt>
```

---

### 6. **What are the advantages of using Node.js?**

#### Answer:
1. **Non-blocking, asynchronous I/O:** Efficiently handles multiple requests.
2. **Single programming language:** JavaScript can be used both on the client and server-side.
3. **Scalability:** Handles concurrent requests with minimal overhead.
4. **Large ecosystem:** NPM provides a vast library of packages.
5. **Fast execution:** Powered by Google's V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript to machine code.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example: Non-blocking asynchronous code advantage
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File data:', data);
});

console.log('I can handle more requests while reading the file!');
```

#### Output:
```
I can handle more requests while reading the file!
File data: <Contents of file.txt>
```

---

### 7. **What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript in the browser?**

#### Answer:
- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime, no access to DOM, can perform file system operations, has access to global objects like `process`, and runs on the V8 engine.
- **JavaScript in Browser:** Client-side, can manipulate DOM, has access to `window` and `document`, but no file system access.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Browser JavaScript: Manipulating DOM
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "Hello from Browser JS!";

// Node.js: Server-side task
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('test.txt', 'Hello from Node.js!');
```

#### Output (Browser):
```
Changes the content of an HTML element.
```

#### Output (Node.js):
```
Creates a file 'test.txt' with the content 'Hello from Node.js!'
```

---

### 8. **What is the role of the V8 engine in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
The **V8 Engine** is Google's high-performance JavaScript engine. In Node.js, V8 is responsible for converting JavaScript code directly into machine code, which allows for fast execution and optimization. V8 also manages memory and garbage collection.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example to demonstrate V8 performance
console.time('Execution Time');
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  // Fast execution due to V8 optimization
}
console.timeEnd('Execution Time');
```

#### Output:
```
Execution Time: <Some milliseconds>
```

---

### 9. **What are global objects in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
Node.js provides global objects that are accessible in all modules without the need for imports. Some common global objects are:
- `__dirname`: Directory name of the current module.
- `__filename`: File name of the current module.
- `global`: Global object like `window` in the browser.
- `require()`: To import modules.
- `process`: Provides information about the current Node.js process.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example of global objects
console.log(__dirname);  // Outputs the directory path
console.log(__filename); // Outputs the file path
```

#### Output:
```
/Users/username/projects
/Users/username/projects/example.js
```

---

### 10. **Explain the concept of non-blocking I/O in Node.js.**

#### Answer:
Non-blocking I/O ka matlab hai ki I/O operations (like reading a file, database queries) background mein asynchronous tarike se perform hote hain. Main thread block nahi hota, balki agle tasks ko handle karta hai, aur jab operation complete hota hai, tab callback function execute hota hai.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Example of non-blocking I/O
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('This will execute before file reading is complete.');
```

#### Output:
```
This will execute before file reading is complete.
File content: <Contents of file.txt>
```

---

### 1. **What is a module in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
A **module** in Node.js is a reusable block of code that can be loaded into other files. It encapsulates code, making it easier to maintain and manage. Node.js follows the **CommonJS** module system, where each file is treated as a module by default.

#### Example:

```javascript
// exampleModule.js
const message = 'Hello from module!';
module.exports = message;
```

```javascript
// main.js
const message = require('./exampleModule');
console.log(message);
```

#### Output:
```
Hello from module!
```

---

### 2. **How do you create and export a module in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To create a module, you simply define some functionality inside a JavaScript file. To export that functionality, you use `module.exports`. Then, in another file, you can import it using `require()`.

#### Example:

```javascript
// mathModule.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = { add };
```

```javascript
// app.js
const math = require('./mathModule');
console.log(math.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

#### Output:
```
8
```

---

### 3. **What is `require()` in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
`require()` is a built-in function in Node.js that is used to import modules, whether they are local modules, core modules, or third-party modules installed via NPM. It loads the module and returns the `module.exports` object.

#### Example:

```javascript
// logger.js
module.exports = function (msg) {
  console.log(msg);
};

// app.js
const logger = require('./logger');
logger('Hello from logger!');
```

#### Output:
```
Hello from logger!
```

---

### 4. **Explain the difference between `require()` and `import` in Node.js.**

#### Answer:
- **`require()`**: CommonJS syntax used in Node.js. It is synchronous and used to load modules dynamically at runtime. Supported in all Node.js versions.
  
- **`import`**: ES6 module syntax, which is asynchronous and used for loading modules statically. To use `import` in Node.js, you need to use `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` or name your files with the `.mjs` extension.

#### Example using `require()`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');  // CommonJS syntax
```

#### Example using `import`:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';  // ES6 module syntax
```

---

### 5. **What are Node.js core modules?**

#### Answer:
**Node.js core modules** are built-in modules that come with Node.js out of the box. They provide basic functionalities and do not require installation. Examples include:

- **`fs`**: File system operations
- **`http`**: HTTP server creation
- **`path`**: Path manipulation
- **`os`**: Operating system-related utilities

#### Example:

```javascript
const os = require('os');
console.log('System architecture:', os.arch());
```

#### Output:
```
System architecture: x64
```

---

### 6. **What is NPM (Node Package Manager)?**

#### Answer:
**NPM** is the default package manager for Node.js. It helps you install, update, manage, and share packages (libraries or modules) that can be used in Node.js projects. It also helps manage project dependencies through `package.json`.

---

### 7. **How do you install, update, and uninstall packages using NPM?**

#### Answer:
1. **Install a package**: Use `npm install` or `npm i`.
   - To install locally: `npm install package-name`
   - To install globally: `npm install -g package-name`

2. **Update a package**: Use `npm update`.
   - Example: `npm update package-name`

3. **Uninstall a package**: Use `npm uninstall`.
   - Example: `npm uninstall package-name`

#### Example:

```bash
# Install express package
npm install express

# Update express package
npm update express

# Uninstall express package
npm uninstall express
```

---

### 8. **What is the role of `package.json` in a Node.js project?**

#### Answer:
The **`package.json`** file is the central configuration file for a Node.js project. It stores metadata about the project (like name, version, and description), dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.

#### Example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

#### Usage:
```bash
# Install dependencies listed in package.json
npm install
```

---

### 9. **What is the purpose of `package-lock.json`?**

#### Answer:
The **`package-lock.json`** file ensures that the exact versions of dependencies are installed across different environments. It "locks" the dependency tree to a specific version to prevent unexpected issues due to package updates.

#### Example:
If you run `npm install`, the specific versions of dependencies listed in `package-lock.json` will be installed.

---

### 10. **What are NPM scripts, and how do you use them?**

#### Answer:
**NPM scripts** allow you to define custom commands in the `package.json` file that can be run using the `npm run` command. These scripts can automate tasks like running tests, starting the server, or building the project.

#### Example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "test": "echo \"Running tests...\""
  }
}
```

#### Usage:
```bash
# Run the start script
npm run start

# Run the test script
npm run test
```

#### Output:
```
Running tests...
```

---
Let's go step by step with explanations, examples, and output for each concept.

---

### 1. **Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js.**

#### Answer:
- **Synchronous Programming**: In synchronous code, each operation waits for the previous one to complete before moving on. This means the program is blocked until the task is completed.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: In asynchronous code, tasks can be initiated and the program continues to run without waiting for them to complete. This is useful for I/O operations, as the program can handle other tasks while waiting for the operation to finish.

#### Example:

**Synchronous Example:**

```javascript
// Synchronous code
console.log('Start');
const result = calculate();  // Imagine this is a time-consuming task
console.log('Result:', result);
console.log('End');
```

#### Output:
```
Start
Result: <calculated value>
End
```

**Asynchronous Example:**

```javascript
// Asynchronous code
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout finished');
}, 1000);

console.log('End');
```

#### Output:
```
Start
End
Timeout finished
```

---

### 2. **What are callbacks in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
A **callback** is a function passed as an argument to another function. In Node.js, callbacks are primarily used to handle asynchronous operations. Once the asynchronous operation is completed, the callback function is executed.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Callback example
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('This runs before the file reading is complete.');
```

#### Output:
```
This runs before the file reading is complete.
File content: <contents of example.txt>
```

---

### 3. **What are Promises in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
A **Promise** is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks. A Promise can be in one of three states:
- **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation was completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Promise example
const fs = require('fs').promises;

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8')
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('File content:', data);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error:', err);
  });

console.log('This runs before the file reading is complete.');
```

#### Output:
```
This runs before the file reading is complete.
File content: <contents of example.txt>
```

---

### 4. **Explain the concept of async/await in Node.js.**

#### Answer:
**`async/await`** is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, providing a way to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. The `async` keyword is used to define asynchronous functions, and `await` is used to wait for a Promise to resolve.

#### Example:

```javascript
// async/await example
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
  }
}

readFile();
console.log('This runs before the file reading is complete.');
```

#### Output:
```
This runs before the file reading is complete.
File content: <contents of example.txt>
```

---

### 5. **What is the difference between callbacks and promises?**

#### Answer:
- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to other functions. They are invoked once the asynchronous operation is complete, but can lead to "callback hell" when deeply nested.
  
- **Promises**: Provide a more structured and cleaner approach to handling asynchronous operations, reducing the nesting issues associated with callbacks.

#### Example:

**Callback Hell:**

```javascript
doSomething(function(err, result1) {
  if (err) throw err;
  doSomethingElse(result1, function(err, result2) {
    if (err) throw err;
    moreAsyncWork(result2, function(err, result3) {
      if (err) throw err;
      // Continue...
    });
  });
});
```

**Using Promises:**

```javascript
doSomething()
  .then(result1 => doSomethingElse(result1))
  .then(result2 => moreAsyncWork(result2))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

---

### 6. **What is callback hell, and how do you avoid it?**

#### Answer:
**Callback Hell** refers to the situation where callbacks are nested inside other callbacks, leading to code that is difficult to read and maintain. It occurs when multiple asynchronous operations are dependent on each other.

#### How to Avoid:
- Use **Promises**.
- Use **async/await**.
- Modularize code into smaller functions.

#### Example (Refactored using async/await):

```javascript
async function performTasks() {
  try {
    const result1 = await doSomething();
    const result2 = await doSomethingElse(result1);
    const result3 = await moreAsyncWork(result2);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

performTasks();
```

---

### 7. **What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
**EventEmitter** is a core module in Node.js that facilitates event-driven architecture. It allows objects to emit and listen to events. By using `EventEmitter`, you can create custom events and handle them using listeners.

#### Example:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Create a listener for 'greet' event
eventEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emit the 'greet' event
eventEmitter.emit('greet', 'John');
```

#### Output:
```
Hello, John!
```

---

### 8. **How do you handle errors in asynchronous code?**

#### Answer:
Errors in asynchronous code can be handled using:
- **Callbacks**: The first argument in a callback is usually the error, e.g., `function(err, result)`.
- **Promises**: Handle errors using `.catch()`.
- **async/await**: Use `try...catch` blocks to handle errors.

#### Example (Handling errors with async/await):

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('nonexistent.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log('File content:', data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err.message);
  }
}

readFile();
```

#### Output:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'nonexistent.txt'
```

---

### 9. **What is the purpose of `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
`process.nextTick()` schedules a callback function to be executed after the current operation completes but before any I/O events (like timers or file I/O) are processed in the next iteration of the event loop. It's used to handle tasks that should happen immediately after the current execution.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('Next Tick');
});

console.log('End');
```

#### Output:
```
Start
End
Next Tick
```

---

### 10. **How does the `setTimeout()` function work in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
`setTimeout()` schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It doesn't block the event loop; the program continues running while the timer is counting down in the background.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout executed');
}, 2000);  // 2-second delay

console.log('End');
```

#### Output:
```
Start
End
Timeout executed
```

---
### 1. **How do you read a file in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To read a file in Node.js, you can use the `fs.readFile()` method, which reads the entire contents of a file asynchronously into memory.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Reading a file asynchronously
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File content:', data);
  }
});
```

#### Output:
```
File content: <contents of example.txt>
```

---

### 2. **What is the difference between `fs.readFile()` and `fs.createReadStream()`?**

#### Answer:
- **`fs.readFile()`**: Reads the entire file into memory at once, which can be inefficient for large files as it consumes a lot of memory.
  
- **`fs.createReadStream()`**: Reads the file in chunks using streams, which is more memory-efficient for large files because it processes small parts of the file at a time.

#### Example using `fs.createReadStream()`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Reading a file using stream
const stream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', 'utf8');

stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log('Chunk received:', chunk);
});

stream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('File reading finished.');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Chunk received: <part of file content>
File reading finished.
```

---

### 3. **How do you write a file in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You can use `fs.writeFile()` to write data to a file asynchronously. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Writing to a file asynchronously
fs.writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello, World!', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File written successfully.');
});
```

#### Output:
```
File written successfully.
```

---

### 4. **How do you append data to a file in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To append data to a file, you can use `fs.appendFile()`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Appending data to a file
fs.appendFile('output.txt', '\nAppended Text', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Data appended to file.');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Data appended to file.
```

---

### 5. **Explain the concept of streams in Node.js.**

#### Answer:
**Streams** in Node.js are objects that allow you to read or write data continuously, piece by piece, instead of waiting for the entire data to load. This is especially useful for large files or data.

Streams are used to handle **I/O** operations efficiently in Node.js. Streams are event-driven, meaning they emit events such as `data`, `end`, `error`, etc.

---

### 6. **What are the types of streams in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
There are **four types of streams** in Node.js:
1. **Readable Streams**: Stream data for reading (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).
2. **Writable Streams**: Stream data for writing (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`).
3. **Duplex Streams**: Stream that can be both readable and writable (e.g., `net.Socket`).
4. **Transform Streams**: A type of duplex stream where the output is transformed based on the input (e.g., `zlib.createGzip`).

---

### 7. **What is the purpose of `fs.stat()` method?**

#### Answer:
The `fs.stat()` method is used to get information about a file or directory. It returns an object containing details such as file size, creation date, and whether it's a file or directory.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Getting file statistics
fs.stat('example.txt', (err, stats) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File Stats:', stats);
  console.log('Is file:', stats.isFile());
  console.log('Is directory:', stats.isDirectory());
});
```

#### Output:
```
File Stats: <stat object>
Is file: true
Is directory: false
```

---

### 8. **How do you handle file errors in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
Errors in file operations can be handled by checking the error argument in the callback functions of file methods like `fs.readFile()`, `fs.writeFile()`, etc.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Handling file errors
fs.readFile('nonexistent.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err.message);  // Handling file read error
  } else {
    console.log('File content:', data);
  }
});
```

#### Output:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'nonexistent.txt'
```

---

### 9. **How do you watch for file changes in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You can use `fs.watch()` to watch for changes in a file or directory. This will emit events whenever the file or directory is modified.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Watching a file for changes
fs.watch('example.txt', (eventType, filename) => {
  if (filename) {
    console.log(`File ${filename} has been modified. Event: ${eventType}`);
  }
});
```

#### Output:
```
File example.txt has been modified. Event: change
```

---

### 10. **What is the difference between `fs.unlink()` and `fs.rmdir()`?**

#### Answer:
- **`fs.unlink()`**: This method is used to delete a file.
  
- **`fs.rmdir()`**: This method is used to remove a directory. However, it can only delete empty directories. For non-empty directories, `fs.rmdir()` will throw an error.

#### Example of `fs.unlink()`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Deleting a file
fs.unlink('output.txt', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File deleted successfully.');
});
```

#### Example of `fs.rmdir()`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Deleting a directory
fs.rmdir('myFolder', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Directory deleted successfully.');
});
```

### 1. **How do you create a basic HTTP server in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To create a basic HTTP server in Node.js, you can use the `http` module. The server can listen to incoming requests and respond accordingly.

#### Example:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Creating a basic HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200; // HTTP status code
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain'); // Setting response header
  res.end('Hello, World!\n'); // Sending response
});

// Server listens on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Server running at http://localhost:3000/
```

---

### 2. **What is the purpose of `http.createServer()` in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
The `http.createServer()` method is used to create an instance of an HTTP server. It takes a callback function as an argument that is executed whenever an HTTP request is received. This function has access to the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects, which are used to handle client requests and send responses.

---

### 3. **How do you handle HTTP requests and responses in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You handle HTTP requests and responses by defining a callback function in `http.createServer()`, where you can access the request and response objects to read data from the request and send a response back.

#### Example:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Handling different routes
  if (req.url === '/') {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Welcome to the homepage!\n');
  } else if (req.url === '/about') {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('About Page\n');
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('404 Not Found\n');
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Server running at http://localhost:3000/
```
- Accessing `http://localhost:3000/` returns "Welcome to the homepage!"
- Accessing `http://localhost:3000/about` returns "About Page"
- Accessing `http://localhost:3000/unknown` returns "404 Not Found"

---

### 4. **What is the difference between `http` and `https` modules in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
- **`http` Module**: Used for creating HTTP servers and clients. It transmits data in plaintext and does not provide any security.
  
- **`https` Module**: Used for creating secure HTTP servers and clients. It encrypts the data using TLS/SSL, making it secure for sensitive data transmission.

---

### 5. **How do you handle query parameters in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You can handle query parameters using the `url` module, which provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.

#### Example:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const queryObject = url.parse(req.url, true).query; // Parsing query parameters
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  res.end(JSON.stringify(queryObject)); // Sending back the query parameters
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
- Accessing `http://localhost:3000/?name=John&age=30` returns:
```json
{"name":"John","age":"30"}
```

---

### 6. **How do you handle POST requests in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To handle POST requests, you need to listen for data events on the request object and concatenate the chunks of data. Once the data is fully received, you can process it.

#### Example:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    let body = '';

    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk.toString(); // Convert Buffer to string
    });

    req.on('end', () => {
      res.statusCode = 200;
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Data received', data: body }));
    });
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 405; // Method Not Allowed
    res.end('Method Not Allowed');
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
- Sending a POST request with body `{"name":"John"}` returns:
```json
{"message":"Data received","data":"{\"name\":\"John\"}"}
```

---

### 7. **What is the purpose of `req` and `res` objects in an HTTP server?**

#### Answer:
- **`req` (Request) Object**: Represents the incoming HTTP request. It contains information such as request headers, request method (GET, POST), URL, and any data sent by the client.

- **`res` (Response) Object**: Represents the outgoing HTTP response that is sent back to the client. It contains methods to set response headers, status codes, and to send the response body.

---

### 8. **How do you set headers in an HTTP response in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You can set headers in the response object using the `setHeader()` method before sending the response with `res.end()`.

#### Example:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'myValue'); // Setting custom header
  res.end('Hello with custom header!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Server running at http://localhost:3000/
```

---

### 9. **What are the differences between `http.get()` and `http.request()` methods?**

#### Answer:
- **`http.get()`**: A convenience method for making GET requests. It automatically sets the method to GET and is simpler to use for quick requests.

- **`http.request()`**: A more generic method that allows you to set various options, such as method type (GET, POST), headers, and body. It is used for more complex requests.

#### Example of `http.get()`:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

http.get('http://www.example.com', (res) => {
  console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
}).on('error', (e) => {
  console.error(`Got error: ${e.message}`);
});
```

#### Example of `http.request()`:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const options = {
  hostname: 'www.example.com',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET'
};

const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
  console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
});

req.on('error', (e) => {
  console.error(`Got error: ${e.message}`);
});

req.end();
```

---

### 10. **How do you create an HTTPS server in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To create an HTTPS server, you need to use the `https` module and provide SSL/TLS certificates. You can generate self-signed certificates for testing purposes.

#### Example:

```javascript
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

// Read SSL certificate and key
const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server.cert')
};

const server = https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, secure world!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('HTTPS Server running at https://localhost:3000/');
});
```

#### Output:
```
HTTPS Server running at https://localhost:3000/
```

### Streams and Buffers

---

### 1. **What is a Buffer in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
A Buffer is a global object in Node.js that provides a way to work with binary data. It is a temporary storage space for raw binary data that can be manipulated directly. Buffers are especially useful when dealing with I/O operations, such as reading files or handling network communications.

---

### 2. **What is the difference between a Buffer and a Stream in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
- **Buffer**: Represents a fixed-size chunk of memory that stores binary data. Buffers are used to hold data that is read from or written to files, network streams, etc. Buffers are generally used when you have all the data available at once.

- **Stream**: Represents a sequence of data that can be read or written over time. Streams can handle data in chunks, which makes them suitable for processing large files or continuous data flows without consuming a lot of memory.

---

### 3. **How do you create a Buffer in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You can create a Buffer using the `Buffer` constructor or the static methods like `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()`.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Creating a buffer using Buffer.alloc()
const bufferAlloc = Buffer.alloc(10); // Creates a buffer of 10 bytes
console.log(bufferAlloc); // Output: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>

// Creating a buffer using Buffer.from()
const bufferFrom = Buffer.from('Hello, World!'); // Creates a buffer from a string
console.log(bufferFrom); // Output: <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21>
```

#### Output:
```
<Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
<Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21>
```

---

### 4. **What are writable and readable streams in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
- **Readable Stream**: A stream from which data can be read. Examples include `fs.createReadStream()` and `http.IncomingMessage`. You can consume data from a readable stream using methods like `read()` and event listeners.

- **Writable Stream**: A stream to which data can be written. Examples include `fs.createWriteStream()` and `http.ServerResponse`. You can write data to a writable stream using methods like `write()` and `end()`.

---

### 5. **What is `stream.pipe()` used for in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
The `stream.pipe()` method is used to connect a readable stream to a writable stream, allowing data to flow from the source stream directly into the destination stream. It handles the piping of data automatically, making it easier to transfer data between streams.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Piping data from readableStream to writableStream
readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

writableStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('Data has been piped successfully!');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Data has been piped successfully!
```

---

### 6. **How do you handle backpressure in streams?**

#### Answer:
Backpressure occurs when a writable stream cannot process data as fast as it is being read from a readable stream. You can handle backpressure by checking if the writable stream is ready to accept more data using the `write()` method, which returns a boolean.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  const canWrite = writableStream.write(chunk);
  
  if (!canWrite) {
    console.log('Backpressure: Pausing readable stream');
    readableStream.pause(); // Pause reading from the source stream
  }
});

writableStream.on('drain', () => {
  console.log('Draining: Resuming readable stream');
  readableStream.resume(); // Resume reading from the source stream
});
```

#### Output:
```
Backpressure: Pausing readable stream
Draining: Resuming readable stream
```

---

### 7. **What are Duplex and Transform streams in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
- **Duplex Stream**: A stream that can read and write data. It can operate as both a readable and writable stream. An example is `net.Socket`.

- **Transform Stream**: A type of duplex stream that modifies or transforms the data as it is written and read. An example is `zlib.createGzip()`, which compresses data.

---

### 8. **How do you read large files efficiently using streams in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
To read large files efficiently, you can use the `fs.createReadStream()` method to read the file in chunks instead of loading the entire file into memory at once. This reduces memory usage and improves performance.

#### Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt', { highWaterMark: 16 * 1024 }); // 16KB chunks

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading the file.');
});
```

#### Output:
```
Read 16384 bytes of data.
Finished reading the file.
```

---

### 9. **What is the purpose of the `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()` methods?**

#### Answer:
- **`Buffer.alloc(size)`**: Allocates a new buffer of the specified size filled with zeroes. It is used to create a buffer when the exact data is not yet known.

- **`Buffer.from(array)`**: Creates a buffer from an existing array or string. It is used to convert data into a buffer format for further manipulation.

---

### 10. **How do you convert a buffer to a string in Node.js?**

#### Answer:
You can convert a buffer to a string using the `toString()` method of the Buffer class. You can also specify the encoding format (e.g., 'utf-8', 'ascii').

#### Example:

```javascript
const buffer = Buffer.from('Hello, World!');
const str = buffer.toString('utf-8'); // Converting buffer to string
console.log(str); // Output: Hello, World!
```

#### Output:
```
Hello, World!
```
